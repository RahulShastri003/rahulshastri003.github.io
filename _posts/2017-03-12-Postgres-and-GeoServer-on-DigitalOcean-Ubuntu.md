# Setting Up Postgres/PostGIS and GeoServer on my Ubuntu Instance
This is a basic tutorial for quickly installing Postgres w/ PostGIS and GeoServer on an Ubuntu image using Digital Ocean. Using these steps, you can be up and running in less than 10 minutes.

## Step 1: Launch an instance of Ubuntu on a DigitalOcean droplet
Head over to [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) and setup a droplet. I just used the default Ubuntu installation with 512mb of memory and 20GB on disk. You will get an email with the automatically generated root password. After turning on the droplet, launch the console. Login w/ root username and the password that was sent. It will prompt you to change your password.
