# Adding a SRID to PostGIS
When you install the PostGIS extension for PostgreSQL, it comes with all the standard geographic and projected coordinate systems using the
structured EPSG Geodetic Parameter Dataset, which can be found at the [International Association of Oil & Gas Producers EPSG Homepage](

## Step 1: Install the OGR FDW
I already have the spatially-oriented fdw wrapper "ogr_fdw" installed as part of 
the [PostGIS Bundle 2.3 for PostgreSQL x64 9.6](http://postgis.net/windows_downloads/),
using the StackBuilder Application Installer. If not done so already, you will need to make
sure to install the extensions:
```
CREATE EXTENSION postgis;
CREATE EXTENSION ogr_fdw;
```

## Step 2: Install the Foreign Data Server and Setup a Foreign Data Table
In this case, let's say I wanted to query the High Injury Network, which is listed on the GeoHub Portal [here](http://geohub.lacity.org/datasets/4ba1b8fa8d8946348b29261045298a88_0).
```
CREATE SERVER hin
  FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER ogr_fdw
  OPTIONS (
    datasource 'http://geohub.lacity.org/datasets/4ba1b8fa8d8946348b29261045298a88_0.geojson',
    format 'GeoJSON' );
```
