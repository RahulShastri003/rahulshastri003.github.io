I just finished setting up the data analysis environment on my chromebook. I'll retrace my steps here in case anyone else wants to do the same.

## Step 1: Install Ubuntu
The very first step is to install ubuntu, so you can then install python and all other parts to your data kit. I folowed [this guide](https://www.linux.com/learn/how-easily-install-ubuntu-chromebook-crouton%20), using the Xfce desktop environment. Switch to the Linux environment.

I then used [this guide](https://www.linuxbabe.com/ubuntu/install-google-chrome-ubuntu-16-04-lts) to install the chrome browser (installing within the linux environment.

## Step 2: Install Anaconda
Installing Anaconda is the easiest and quickest way to get the data analytics environment up and running. Within the installed chrome browser, I downloaded [Anaconda for Linux](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), navigated to the Downloads folder in the terminal window, and then installed using the bash command in the instructions.
