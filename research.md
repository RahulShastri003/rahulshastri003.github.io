## Doctoral Research

Quantum thermodynamics is a rich and growing field that asks a fundamental question: what happens to the laws of thermodynamics when we go down to the quantum scale, where both thermal and quantum fluctuations dominate? One approach is to follow the path of pioneers like Sadi Carnot and others, whose work ultimately helped formalize the laws of thermodynamics. This involves studying ideal thermal machines such as heat engines and refrigerators. In a similar spirit, an active area of research within quantum thermodynamics is the study of quantum heat engines (QHEs) and quantum batteries (QBs) that operate using purely quantum effects. In my PhD thesis, I have explored a collection of problems centered around various ways to optimize and highlight the unique quantum features of QHEs and QBs. These included both theoretical and computational studies using the framework of open quantum systems.

The first problem I looked at was a four-stroke, finite-time quantum Otto engine cycle (analogous to the classical Otto engine—the kind that powers car engines). Each of the four strokes occurs over a finite time. We asked whether running the engine in an asymmetric way—spending more time on one stroke than the others—could lead to better performance. Interestingly, we found that for certain asymmetric cycle durations, the engine not only produced more work output but did so more reliably [3].

The next question I considered was the role of quantum measurements (an inherently strange and fascinating aspect of quantum theory) in the performance of quantum heat engines. We asked: could the act of measuring the quantum working substance of a quantum Otto engine actually help control or improve the engine’s performance? By modeling different measurement schemes, we found that some types of measurements could indeed enhance the average work output and reduce fluctuations [2].

Finally, I turned to another interesting device: quantum batteries—tiny quantum systems that can be used to store energy. Since QBs are always in contact with the external environment, we typically expect environmental noise to degrade their performance. But we asked whether environmental noise could actually be useful—and surprisingly, the answer is yes. We showed that a carefully tuned amount of environmental noise (more specifically, dephasing, which tends to destroy quantum coherence) could help charge the QB more quickly and in a more robust manner [1]. This points to a more nuanced view of noise—not always as a hindrance, but sometimes as a helpful tool

## Pre-doctoral research

My research interests before I started my doctoral studies were primarily directed towards the foundations of quantum physics. 

I was first introduced during a reading project to the EPR paper and Bell's inequalities which seemed to me to be an extremely strong result that nature is non-local! Through some reading I came across the body of work that seemed to overcome a lot of the problems of 'Copenhagen' Quantum theory and described quantum physics with particles moving in trajectories while still recovering all known formalisms and results - Bohmian mechanics. So I went on to work with Dr. Detlef Duerr at Ludwig Maximilians Universitaet, Munich, Germany on my Master's thesis on studying a way to describe time of arrival statistics in quantum theory. Conventional quantum theory does not allow the existence of a time operator because its canonical conjugate operator, the Hamiltonian, is a positive self-adjoint operator. However, we do observe phenomena such as the decay of a radioactive substance, emitting particles towards a detector, where we observe an arrival time distribution. Since conventional quantum theory doesn't provide us a formalism to help us describe this phenomenon, we used Positive-Operator-Valued-Measures (POVMs) to describe the arrival time statistics in the context of Bohmian mechanics. 

During my time in Munich, I got interested in various ideas in the foundations of quantum physics. For the latter part of my time there, realizing the problems with the ad-hoc procedure to remove infinities that appeared in Quantum Electrodynamics (renormalization) which still gave extremely accurate predictions about the nature of reality, I tried to look at what I could learn from Wheeler and Feynman's attempt to come up with an underlying description of how a theory could look without needing this ad-hoc procedure of renormalization. The hope was to use the idea of advanced and retarded actions to somehow describe the Lamb shift in QED. Alas, I wasn't able to make much progress (after all, geniuses like Feynman had difficulties in making progress in this direction). I still am extremely curious about how one could overcome the difficulties of renormalization in quantum field theories. 

With the idea of learning about techniques in computing the self-force, I moved to Arizona to work with my now advisor Dr. Samuel Gralla
I worked on studying Wheeler-Feynman Electrodynamics and
