# Doctoral Research

<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 30px;">
We all learn about the laws of thermodynamics in school, for instance, the famous Second Law, which says that the entropy of an isolated system always increases. These laws were first developed to describe everyday objects, like blocks of metal or steam engines, which contain an unimaginably large number of particles . In this situation these laws describe how things behave on average, and the tiny random fluctuations around that average completely disappear.
But something different happens when we zoom in, from large objects down to systems made of only a handful of particles? In this microscopic world, fluctuations are no longer negligible and at the scale of atoms and molecules, classical physics (like Newton’s laws of motion) no longer works. Instead, the strange rules of quantum mechanics take over. This leads us to a natural question: how do the laws of thermodynamics change when applied to small, quantum systems? The field of open quantum systems and quantum thermodynamics is devoted to addressing precisely these kinds of questions. Over the past two decades, thanks to advances in experiments, this field has grown at a rapid pace. One exciting line of thought goes back to the very roots of thermodynamics, when pioneers like Sadi Carnot studied the efficiency of early heat engines and refrigerators. In today's quantum world, that translates into the study of quantum heat engines (QHEs) and quantum batteries (QBs). These are devices that aim to harness uniquely quantum features to perform thermodynamic tasks in ways no classical machine ever could.

In my Ph.D. thesis, I have explored a collection of problems focused on optimizing the performance and highlighting the distinct quantum features of QHEs and QBs. My work involved analytical and numerical investigations thermodynamics of quantum systems using the formalism of open quantum systems and quantum thermodynamics. The first problem I looked at was a simple four-stroke finite-time quantum Otto engine cycle (analogous to the classical Otto engine, the kind that powers our cars). Each of the four strokes occurs over a finite time. We asked whether running the engine in an asymmetric way (spending more time on one stroke than the others) could lead to better performance. Interestingly, we found that for certain asymmetric cycle durations, the engine not only produced more work output but did so more reliably [3].

<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 30px;">
The next question I considered was the role of quantum measurements (an inherently strange and important aspect of quantum theory) on the performance of QHEs. We ask "can measurement performed on quantum working substance of a quantum Otto engine actually help control or improve the engine’s performance?" By modeling different measurement schemes, we found that some types of measurements could indeed enhance the average work output and reduce fluctuations [2].

Finally, I turned to another interesting device called QBs which are tiny quantum systems that can be used to store energy. Since QBs are always in contact with the external environment, we naturally expect environmental noise to degrade their performance. But we asked whether environmental noise could actually be usefuland surprisingly, the answer is yes. We showed that a carefully tuned amount of environmental noise (more specifically, dephasing, which tends to destroy quantum coherence) could help charge the QBs faster and in a more robust manner [1]. This points to a more nuanced view of noise not always as a hindrance, but sometimes as a helpful tool. Also there is a very nice article on this work on Physics World: <a href="https://physicsworld.com/a/when-charging-quantum-batteries-decoherence-is-a-friend-not-a-foe/" target="_blank"> When charging quantum batteries, decoherence is a friend, not a foe</a>.

During my Master's degree in Physics at IIT Gandhinagar, I had the opportunity to engage in two interesting projects that gave me immense joy at that time. For my master’s thesis, I explored something known as Gauge-Higgs Unification (GHU) models, where the Higgs boson emerges as a component of 5-dimensional gauge fields through symmetry-breaking mechanisms. Alongside this, I worked on a short project on geometric phases in quantum mechanics, which offered beautiful insights into how the geometrical properties of wavefunctions can have real observable effects. I have always been fascinated by the simplicity and fundamental nature of theoretical physics, and these experiences deepened my appreciation for the mathematical structure underlying physical theories.

During this time, I also spent a summer at the Physical Research Laboratory in Ahmedabad, working on a project on Langevin equations in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. It was the first time I encountered stochastic dynamical equations, and I was instantly drawn to how randomness and thermodynamics are linked together in describing physical systems out of equilibrium. Looking back, I realize it was a very pleasant experience and played a key role in shaping my interest in thermodynamics, which later led me to choose quantum thermodynamics as the focus of my Ph.D. research.

Immediately after completing my master’s degree and before starting my Ph.D., I worked for about a year as a Project Assistant on a project titled "Zero-Carbon Solar-powered Hydrogen Production via Plasmonic Nano-antenna Enhanced Photocatalytic Water-Splitting." The project focused on developing sustainable methods for hydrogen generation using sunlight. Working on this project gave me significant hands-on experience with tools like COMSOL Multiphysics and other simulation software to model electromagnetic fields and study the absorption and scattering properties of nanomaterials. My work involved understanding and optimizing nanomaterial geometries in the context of their application to artificial photosynthesis through photocatalytic water-splitting. This role significantly strengthened my computational and data analysis skills. It was also the first time I worked on something outside the domain of theoretical physics more on the side of engineering physics with a strong emphasis on practical applications in clean energy technologies.
