# Doctoral Research

Quantum thermodynamics is a rich and growing field that asks a fundamental question: what happens to the laws of thermodynamics when we go down to the quantum scale, where both thermal and quantum fluctuations dominate? One approach is to follow the path of pioneers like Sadi Carnot and others, whose work ultimately helped formalize the laws of thermodynamics. This involves studying ideal thermal machines such as heat engines and refrigerators. In a similar spirit, an active area of research within quantum thermodynamics is the study of quantum heat engines (QHEs) and quantum batteries (QBs) that operate using purely quantum effects. In my PhD thesis, I have explored a collection of problems centered around various ways to optimize and highlight the unique quantum features of QHEs and QBs. These included both theoretical and computational studies using the framework of open quantum systems.

The first problem I looked at was a four-stroke, finite-time quantum Otto engine cycle (analogous to the classical Otto engine—the kind that powers car engines). Each of the four strokes occurs over a finite time. We asked whether running the engine in an asymmetric way—spending more time on one stroke than the others—could lead to better performance. Interestingly, we found that for certain asymmetric cycle durations, the engine not only produced more work output but did so more reliably [3].

The next question I considered was the role of quantum measurements (an inherently strange and fascinating aspect of quantum theory) on the performance of QHEs. We asked: could the act of measuring the quantum working substance of a quantum Otto engine actually help control or improve the engine’s performance? By modeling different measurement schemes, we found that some types of measurements could indeed enhance the average work output and reduce fluctuations [2].

Finally, I turned to another interesting device: QBs—tiny quantum systems that can be used to store energy. Since QBs are always in contact with the external environment, we naturally expect environmental noise to degrade their performance. But we asked whether environmental noise could actually be useful—and surprisingly, the answer is yes. We showed that a carefully tuned amount of environmental noise (more specifically, dephasing, which tends to destroy quantum coherence) could help charge the QBs faster and in a more robust manner [1]. This points to a more nuanced view of noise—not always as a hindrance, but sometimes as a helpful tool
