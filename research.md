# Doctoral Research

Quantum thermodynamics is a rich and growing field that asks a fundamental question: what happens to the laws of thermodynamics when we go down to the quantum scale, where both thermal and quantum fluctuations dominate? One approach is to follow the path of pioneers like Sadi Carnot and others, whose work ultimately helped formalize the laws of thermodynamics. This involves studying ideal thermal machines such as heat engines and refrigerators. In a similar spirit, an active area of research within quantum thermodynamics is the study of quantum heat engines (QHEs) and quantum batteries (QBs) that operate using purely quantum effects. In my PhD thesis, I have explored a collection of problems centered around various ways to optimize and highlight the unique quantum features of QHEs and QBs. These included both theoretical and computational studies using the framework of open quantum systems.

The first problem I looked at was a four-stroke, finite-time quantum Otto engine cycle (analogous to the classical Otto engine—the kind that powers car engines). Each of the four strokes occurs over a finite time. We asked whether running the engine in an asymmetric way—spending more time on one stroke than the others—could lead to better performance. Interestingly, we found that for certain asymmetric cycle durations, the engine not only produced more work output but did so more reliably [3].

The next question I considered was the role of quantum measurements (an inherently strange and fascinating aspect of quantum theory) on the performance of QHEs. We asked: could the act of measuring the quantum working substance of a quantum Otto engine actually help control or improve the engine’s performance? By modeling different measurement schemes, we found that some types of measurements could indeed enhance the average work output and reduce fluctuations [2].

Finally, I turned to another interesting device: QBs—tiny quantum systems that can be used to store energy. Since QBs are always in contact with the external environment, we naturally expect environmental noise to degrade their performance. But we asked whether environmental noise could actually be useful—and surprisingly, the answer is yes. We showed that a carefully tuned amount of environmental noise (more specifically, dephasing, which tends to destroy quantum coherence) could help charge the QBs faster and in a more robust manner [1]. This points to a more nuanced view of noise—not always as a hindrance, but sometimes as a helpful tool

# Pre-doctoral research

During my Masters degree in Physics at IIT Gandhinagar, I had the opportunity to engage in two interesting projects that gave me immense joy at that time. For my master’s thesis, I explored something knows as Gauge-Higgs Unification models, where the Higgs boson emerges as a component of 5 dimensional gauge fields through symmetry-breaking mechanisms. Alongside this, I worked on a short project on geometric phases in quantum mechanics, which offered beautiful insights into how the geometrical properties of wavefunctions can have real observable effects. I have always been fascinated by simplicity and fundamental nature of theoretical physics and these experiences deepened my appreciation for the mathematical structure underlying physical theories.

During this time, I spent a summer at the Physical Research Laboratory in Ahmedabad, working on a project on Langevin equations in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. It was the first time I encountered stochastic dynamical equations, and I was instantly drawn to how randomness and thermodynamics are linked together describing physical systems out of equilibrium. Looking back I realise it was a very pleasant experience and played a key role in shaping my interest in thermodynamics which later led me to choose quantum thermodynamics as the focus of my Ph.D. research.

Immediately after completing my master’s degree and before starting my PhD, I worked for about an year as a Project Assistant on a project titled "Zero-Carbon Solar-powered Hydrogen Production via Plasmonic Nano-antenna Enhanced Photocatalytic Water-Splitting." The project focused on developing sustainable methods for hydrogen generation using sunlight. Working on this project gave me significant hands-on experience with tools like COMSOL Multiphysics and other simulation software to model electromagnetic fields and study the absorption and scattering properties of nanomaterials. My work involved understanding and optimizing nanomaterial geometries in the context of their application to artificial photosynthesis through photocatalytic water-splitting. This role significantly strengthened my computational and data analysis skills. It was also the first time I worked on something outside the domain of theoretical physics—more on the side of engineering physics—with a strong emphasis on practical applications in clean energy technologies.
