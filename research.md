## Doctoral Research

Quantum thermodynamics is a rich and growing field that asks a simple yet profound question like what happens to the laws of thermodynamics when we go into the quantum scale, where both thermal and quantum fluctuations dominate? Within this field, I have looked at the study of  quantum heat engines and quantum batteries that operate using purely quantum effects. In my PhD work, I explored a range of questions about how these devices can be made more efficient or show genuinely quantum behavior. These included both theoretical and computational studies, grounded in the framework of open quantum systems. 

The first system I looked at was a four stroke quantum Otto engine cycle analogous to the classical Otto engine (the kind that powers car engines) [3]. I asked whether running the engine in an asymmetric way—spending more time on one stroke of the cycle than the other—could lead to better performance. Interestingly, we found that for certain asymmetric cycle durations, the engine not only produced more work output but did so more reliably. 

Next, I turned to the role of quantum measurements—an inherently strange and interesting aspect of quantum theory [2]. Here, I asked: could the act of measuring a quantum system actually help control or improve the performance of a quantum engine? By modeling different ways to “peek” at the system during operation, we found that some types of measurement could actually enhance the average work output and reduce fluctuations, compared to traditional approaches. 

Finally, I explored quantum batteries—tiny quantum systems that store energy [1]. The question we ask is whether environmental noise, specifically dephasing (which tends to destroy quantum coherence), could actually be useful. Normally, we think of noise as something that degrades performance, but in this case we found the opposite: a carefully tuned amount of dephasing helped transfer energy more quickly from the charger to the battery, and made the system more robust to imperfections. This points to a more nuanced view of noise—not always as a hindrance, but sometimes as a helpful tool.

## Pre-doctoral research

My research interests before I started my doctoral studies were primarily directed towards the foundations of quantum physics. 

I was first introduced during a reading project to the EPR paper and Bell's inequalities which seemed to me to be an extremely strong result that nature is non-local! Through some reading I came across the body of work that seemed to overcome a lot of the problems of 'Copenhagen' Quantum theory and described quantum physics with particles moving in trajectories while still recovering all known formalisms and results - Bohmian mechanics. So I went on to work with Dr. Detlef Duerr at Ludwig Maximilians Universitaet, Munich, Germany on my Master's thesis on studying a way to describe time of arrival statistics in quantum theory. Conventional quantum theory does not allow the existence of a time operator because its canonical conjugate operator, the Hamiltonian, is a positive self-adjoint operator. However, we do observe phenomena such as the decay of a radioactive substance, emitting particles towards a detector, where we observe an arrival time distribution. Since conventional quantum theory doesn't provide us a formalism to help us describe this phenomenon, we used Positive-Operator-Valued-Measures (POVMs) to describe the arrival time statistics in the context of Bohmian mechanics. 

During my time in Munich, I got interested in various ideas in the foundations of quantum physics. For the latter part of my time there, realizing the problems with the ad-hoc procedure to remove infinities that appeared in Quantum Electrodynamics (renormalization) which still gave extremely accurate predictions about the nature of reality, I tried to look at what I could learn from Wheeler and Feynman's attempt to come up with an underlying description of how a theory could look without needing this ad-hoc procedure of renormalization. The hope was to use the idea of advanced and retarded actions to somehow describe the Lamb shift in QED. Alas, I wasn't able to make much progress (after all, geniuses like Feynman had difficulties in making progress in this direction). I still am extremely curious about how one could overcome the difficulties of renormalization in quantum field theories. 

With the idea of learning about techniques in computing the self-force, I moved to Arizona to work with my now advisor Dr. Samuel Gralla
I worked on studying Wheeler-Feynman Electrodynamics and
